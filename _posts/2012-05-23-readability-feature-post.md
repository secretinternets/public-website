## Northwest Artist Name Authority File and Thesaurus | Seattle Art Museum

This project originated from an inquiry by the Seattle Art Museum Library for a controlled vocabulary to manage a list of artist names relating the institution's “Northwest Artists Exhibition Series” archival collection. Library staff had difficulty answering reference questions because the artist names were not adequately indexed. As part of a project team, I created the Seattle Art Museum Name Authority File (SAM NAF) and the related Pacific Northwest Artist Thesaurus (PNAT) to meet needs of library staff and users. For the SAM NAF, I developed the authority file structure and created authority records. This project highlighted challenges related to the authority file creation for artists: anonymous artists, pseudonyms, variant names, and typographic errors.

The PNAT was developed in tandem with the NAF to create a conceptual framework for proper names of northwest artists and related terminology. Although originally conceived for the Seattle Art Museum, the project team intentionally developed this thesaurus to work with various collections. This vocabulary enables description, search and retrieval of cultural objects and information resources associated with Northwest artists. For this project I researched and contributed to the domain analysis, functional requirements, and selected, defined, and determined the hierarchical structure for individuals, corporate bodies, and historical events. The thesaurus is viewable in classification notation and as a complete list of terms.
